# TalkWithPage

If you talk with page you must use Turkish words because i supported Turkish lang for now. 
I want to add other lang next time.

You can read your page, go next page or last page and search something in Google with Talk with Page Google extension.
The read feature language is English. 
First of all I want to be this project only Turkish but SpeechSynthesisUtterance is not supported Turkish in Google Chrome.
So I set the application language to English.

If you want to go next page, just click Talk with Page and say "ileri git" or "sonraki sayfaya git", etc.
If you want to go last page, just Talk with Page and say "geri git" or "önceki sayfaya git", etc.
If you want to read this page , just Talk with Page and say "oku" or " Sayfayı oku", etc.
If you want to stop reading this page, just Talk with Page and say "dur" or "okumayı durdur" , etc.
If you want to search something in Google, just Talk with Page and say "İzmirin plaka kodu kaç?" or "Google'da iftar saatlerini bul", etc.
